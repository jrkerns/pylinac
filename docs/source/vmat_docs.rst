Overview
--------

.. automodule:: pylinac.vmat
    :no-members:


.. note::
    In the examples below, these classes can generally be used interchangeably.
    Where differences matter, they are explicitly noted.



Running the Demos
-----------------

For this example we will use the DRGS class:

.. plot::

    from pylinac import DRGS
    DRGS.run_demo()

Results will be printed to the console and a figure showing both the Open field and MLC field image will pop up::

    Dose Rate & Gantry Speed
    Test Results (Tol. +/-1.5%): PASS
    Max Deviation: 1.01%
    Absolute Mean Deviation: 0.459%

Image Acquisition
-----------------

If you want to perform these specific QA tests, you'll need DICOM plan files that control the linac precisely to deliver the test fields.
These can be downloaded from my.varian.com. Once logged in, search for RapidArc and you should see two items called "RapidArc QA Test Procedures
and Files for TrueBeam" (same for C-series) or "RapidArc Dynamic QA Test Procedures and Files for TrueBeam". Use the RT Plan files and follow the instructions,
not including the assessment procedure, which is the point of this module. Save & move the VMAT images to a place you can use pylinac.

Prefabricated plans are available at :ref:`prefab-rt-plans` for download. See also the
:ref:`plan-generator` module for creating your own plans.

Typical Use
-----------

The VMAT QA analysis follows what is specified in the Varian QA Test Procedures and assumes your tests will run the exact same way.
Import the appropriate class:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import DRGS, DRMLC, DRCS

The minimum needed to get going is to:

* **Load images** -- Loading the EPID DICOM images into your VMAT class object can be done by passing the file paths,
  passing a ZIP archive, or passing a URL:

  .. code-block:: python

      # Load images directly
      open_img = "C:/QA Folder/VMAT/open_field.dcm"
      dmlc_img = "C:/QA Folder/VMAT/dmlc_field.dcm"
      my_drgs = DRGS(image_paths=(open_img, dmlc_img))

      # or load from zip
      my_drgs = DRGS.from_zip(r"C:/path/to/zip.zip")

      # or load from a URL
      my_drgs = DRGS.from_url("http://myserver.org/vmat.zip")


  Finally, if you don't have any images, you can use the demo ones provided:

  .. code-block:: python

     my_drgs = DRGS.from_demo_images()

* **Analyze the images** -- Once the images are loaded, tell the class to analyze the images.
  See the Algorithm section for details on how this is done. Tolerance can also be passed and has a default value of 1.5%:

  .. code-block:: python

      my_drgs.analyze(tolerance=1.5)

* **View/Save the results** -- The VMAT module can print out the summary of results to the console as well as draw a matplotlib image to show where the
  segments were placed and their values:

  .. code-block:: python

      # print results to the console
      print(my_drgs.results())
      # view analyzed images
      my_drgs.plot_analyzed_image()

  .. plot::
      :include-source: false

      import pylinac

      pylinac.DRGS.run_demo()

  PDF reports can also be generated:

  .. code-block:: python

    my_drgs.publish_pdf("drgs.pdf")

.. _customizing_vmat_analysis:

Customizing the analysis
------------------------

You can alter both the segment size and segment positions as desired.

Customizing the segment size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the segment size:

.. code-block:: python

    drgs = DRGS.from_demo_image()
    drgs.analyze(..., segment_size_mm=(10, 150))
    # ROI segments will now be 10mm wide by 150mm tall

Customizing the ROI posisition on DRGS/DRMLC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the x-position of the ROI segments or change the number of ROI, use a custom ROI config dictionary and pass it to the ``analyze`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import DRGS, DRMLC

    # note the keys are the names of the ROIs and can be anything you like
    custom_roi_config = {
        "200 MU/min": {"offset_mm": -100},
        "300 MU/min": {"offset_mm": -80},
    }  # add more as needed

    my_drgs = DRGS(...)  # works the same way for DRMLC
    my_drgs.analyze(..., roi_config=custom_roi_config)

.. plot::
    :include-source: false

    from pylinac import DRGS

    # note the keys are the names of the ROIs and can be anything you like
    custom_roi_config = {'200 MU/min': {'offset_mm': -20}, '300 MU/min': {'offset_mm': 20}}

    my_drgs = DRGS.from_demo_images()
    my_drgs.analyze(roi_config=custom_roi_config)
    my_drgs.plot_analyzed_image()

Customizing the ROI posisition on DRCS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the position of the ROI segments or change the number of ROI, use a custom ROI config dictionary and pass it to the ``analyze`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import DRGS, DRMLC

    # note the keys are the names of the ROIs and can be anything you like
    custom_roi_config = {
        "15 deg/sec": {"radial_distance": 50, "angle": -120},
        "12 deg/sec": {"radial_distance": 60, "angle": -60},
    }  # add more as needed

    my_drcs = DRCS(...)
    my_drcs.analyze(..., roi_config=custom_roi_config)

Accessing Data
--------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

Using the VMAT module in your own scripts? While the analysis results can be printed out,
if you intend on using them elsewhere (e.g. in an API), they can be accessed the easiest by using the :meth:`~pylinac.vmat.VMATBase.results_data` method
which returns a :class:`~pylinac.vmat.VMATResult` instance.

.. note::
    While the pylinac tooling may change under the hood, this object should remain largely the same and/or expand.
    Thus, using this is more stable than accessing attrs directly.

Continuing from above:

.. code-block:: python

    data = my_drgs.results_data()
    data.test_type
    data.passed
    # and more

    # return as a dict
    data_dict = my_drgs.results_data(as_dict=True)
    data_dict["test_type"]
    ...

Analysis Parameters
-------------------

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: usage

   .. tab-item:: pylinac
      :sync: pylinac

      See :meth:`pylinac.vmat.DRMLC.analyze`, :meth:`pylinac.vmat.DRGS.analyze`, :meth:`pylinac.vmat.DRCS.analyze` for details.

   .. tab-item:: RadMachine
      :sync: radmachine

      * **Number of ROIs**: The number of ROIs to analyze. By default, the DRGS test is 7 and the DRMLC is 4.
      * **ROI spacing**: The spacing between the ROIs in mm.
      * **Tolerance**: The tolerance in % allowed deviation from the average ratioed response.
      * **Use raw pixels**: Whether to use the raw pixel values or the tag-corrected values. See :ref:`vmat-other-programs` and :ref:`vmat-doselab`.
      * **ROI segment width**: The width of the ROI segments in mm. By default, 5mm.
      * **ROI segment height**: The height of the ROI segments in mm. By default, 100mm.

.. _vmat-algorithm:

Algorithm
---------

The VMAT analysis algorithm is based on the "Varian RapidArc QA tests and procedures for C-Series and TrueBeam",
and "Varian RapidArc Dynamic QA Test Procedures for TrueBeam".
All three VMAT tests in this module follow the same core principle of comparing ROIs against each other,
but their ROI placement strategies differ:

* DRGS and DRMLC use lateral offsetâ€“based placement.
* DRCS determines ROI placement based on angular position.

The algorithm works like such:

**Allowances**

* The images can be acquired at any SID.
* The images can be acquired with any EPID (aS500, aS1000, aS1200).

**Restrictions**

.. warning:: Analysis can fail or give unreliable results if any Restriction is violated.

* The tests must be delivered using the DICOM RT plan files provided by Varian.
* The images must be acquired with the EPID.

**Pre-Analysis**

* **Determine image scaling** -- Segment determination is based on offsets from the center pixel of the image. However,
  some physicists use 150 cm SID and others use 100 cm, and others can use a clinical setting that may be different
  than either of those. To account for this, the SID is determined and then scaling factors are determined to be
  able to perform properly-sized segment analysis.
* **Identify open/DMLC images** -- The images can be passed in any order, pylinac will automatically identify them.
* **Determine ratio image** -- The ratio image is defined as :math:`I_{ratio} = \frac{I_{DRGS}}{I_{open}}`

.. versionadded:: 3.36

**Analysis**

.. note::
    Calculations tend to be lazy, computed only on demand. This represents a nominal analysis
    where all calculations are performed.

* **Calculate sample boundaries** -- On DRGS/DRMLC, the Segment x-positions are based on offsets from the center of the
  FWHM of the detected field. This allows for old and new style tests that have an x-offset from each other.
  These values are then scaled with the image scaling factor determined above. DRCS assumes a centered image.
* **Calculate segment readings** -- For each segment, the mean pixel value is determined for the ratio image: :math:`R_{corr}(x)`.
* **Calculate segment deviations** -- Segment deviation is then calculated once all the segment readings are determined.
  The average absolute deviation is also calculated.
  :math:`R_{deviation}(x) = \frac{R_{corr}(x)}{\bar{R_{corr}}} * 100 - 100`, where :math:`\bar{R_{corr}}` is the average of all segments.

**Post-Analysis**

* **Test if segments pass tolerance** -- Each segment is checked to see if it was within the specified tolerance. If any samples
  fail, the whole test is considered failing.

.. _interpreting-vmat-results:

Interpreting Results
--------------------

This section explains what is returned in the ``results_data`` object.
This is also the same information that is given in the RadMachine results
section.

* ``pylinac_version`` -- The version of Pylinac that was used to perform the analysis.
* ``date_of_analysis`` -- The date the analysis was performed.
* ``test_type`` -- The type of test that was performed as a string.
* ``tolerance_percent`` -- The tolerance used to determine if the test passed or failed.
* ``passed`` -- A boolean indicating if the test passed or failed.
* ``abs_mean_deviation`` -- The average absolute deviation of all segments.
* ``max_deviation_percent`` -- The maximum deviation of any segment.
* ``segment_data`` -- A list of :class:`~pylinac.vmat.SegmentResult` instances. Each instance contains the following attributes:

  * ``passed`` -- A boolean indicating if the segment passed or failed.
  * ``x_position_mm`` -- The position of the segment ROI in mm from CAX (lateral offset if DRGS/DRMLC, radial distance if DRCS)."
  * ``angular_position_deg`` -- The angle of the segment ROI in degrees.
  * ``r_corr`` -- :math:`R_{corr}` as defined :ref:`above <vmat-algorithm>`.
  * ``r_dev`` -- :math:`R_{deviation}` as defined :ref:`above <vmat-algorithm>`.
  * ``stdev`` -- The standard deviation of the segment i.e. :math:`\sigma \left( R_{ratio} \right)`
  * ``center_x_y`` -- The center of the segment in pixel coordinates.

Benchmarking the Algorithm
--------------------------

With the image generator module we can create test images to test the VMAT algorithm on known results. This is useful to isolate what is or isn't working
if the algorithm doesn't work on a given image and when commissioning pylinac.

.. note::

    The below examples are for the DRMLC test but can equally be applied to the DRGS tests as well.

Perfect Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we generate a perfectly flat set of images and analyze them.

.. plot::

    import pylinac
    from pylinac.core.image_generator import GaussianFilterLayer, PerfectFieldLayer, AS1200Image

    # open image
    open_path = 'perfect_open_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    as1200.add_layer(PerfectFieldLayer(field_size_mm=(150, 110), cax_offset_mm=(0, 0)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=open_path)

    # DMLC image
    dmlc_path = 'perfect_dmlc_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    for offset in (-45, -15, 15, 45):
        as1200.add_layer(PerfectFieldLayer((150, 19.5), cax_offset_mm=(0, offset)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=dmlc_path)

    # analyze it
    vmat = pylinac.DRMLC(image_paths=(open_path, dmlc_path))
    vmat.analyze()
    print(vmat.results())
    vmat.plot_analyzed_image()

with output::

    Dose Rate & MLC Speed
    Test Results (Tol. +/-1.5%): PASS
    Max Deviation: 0.0%
    Absolute Mean Deviation: 0.0%

Noisy, Realistic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now add a horn effect and random noise to the data:

.. plot::

    import pylinac
    from pylinac.core.image_generator import GaussianFilterLayer, FilteredFieldLayer, AS1200Image, RandomNoiseLayer

    # open image
    open_path = 'noisy_open_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    as1200.add_layer(FilteredFieldLayer(field_size_mm=(150, 110), cax_offset_mm=(0, 0)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.add_layer(RandomNoiseLayer(sigma=0.03))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=open_path)

    # DMLC image
    dmlc_path = 'noisy_dmlc_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    for offset in (-45, -15, 15, 45):
        as1200.add_layer(FilteredFieldLayer((150, 19.5), cax_offset_mm=(0, offset)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.add_layer(RandomNoiseLayer(sigma=0.03))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=dmlc_path)

    # analyze it
    vmat = pylinac.DRMLC(image_paths=(open_path, dmlc_path))
    vmat.analyze()
    print(vmat.results())
    vmat.plot_analyzed_image()

with output::

    Dose Rate & MLC Speed
    Test Results (Tol. +/-1.5%): PASS
    Max Deviation: 0.0332%
    Absolute Mean Deviation: 0.0257%

Erroneous data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's now get devious and randomly adjust the height of each ROI (effectively changing the apparent MLC speed):

.. note::

    Due to the purposely random nature shown below, this exact result is likely not reproducible, nor was it intended to be.
    To get reproducible behavior, use numpy with a seed value.

.. plot::

    import random

    import pylinac
    from pylinac.core.image_generator import GaussianFilterLayer, FilteredFieldLayer, AS1200Image, RandomNoiseLayer

    # open image
    open_path = 'noisy_open_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    as1200.add_layer(FilteredFieldLayer(field_size_mm=(150, 110), cax_offset_mm=(0, 0)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.add_layer(RandomNoiseLayer(sigma=0.03))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=open_path)

    # DMLC image
    dmlc_path = 'noisy_dmlc_drmlc.dcm'
    as1200 = AS1200Image()
    for offset in (-45, -15, 15, 45):
        as1200.add_layer(FilteredFieldLayer((150, 19.5), cax_offset_mm=(0, offset), alpha=random.uniform(0.93, 1)))
    as1200.add_layer(GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=2))
    as1200.add_layer(RandomNoiseLayer(sigma=0.04))
    as1200.generate_dicom(file_out_name=dmlc_path)

    # analyze it
    vmat = pylinac.DRMLC(image_paths=(open_path, dmlc_path))
    vmat.analyze()
    print(vmat.results())
    vmat.plot_analyzed_image()

with an output of::

    Dose Rate & MLC Speed
    Test Results (Tol. +/-1.5%): FAIL
    Max Deviation: 2.12%
    Absolute Mean Deviation: 1.13%

.. _vmat-other-programs:

Comparing to other programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    The DRGS pattern is used as an example but the same concepts applies to both DRGS and DRMLC.

A common question is how results should be compared to other programs. While
the answer will depend on several factors, we can make some general observations here.

* **Ensure the ROI sizes are similar** - Different programs may have different defaults for the ROI size.
  Varian suggests a 5x100mm rectangular ROI, although this seems arbitrarily small in our opinion.
  In any event, to match Varian's suggestion, the pylinac default segment ROI size is 5x100mm
* **DICOM images may have different reconstruction algorithms** - Pylinac's DICOM image loading
  algorithm can be read here: :ref:`pixel_inversion`. It tries to use as many tags as it can to
  reconstruct the correct pixel values. However, this behavior does not appear consistent across
  all programs. E.g. if tags are not considered when loading images, the resulting pixels (and
  thus ratio) may not match an image that did use tags.

  Take for instance the below example comparing "raw" pixel values to using the Tag-corrected version:

  .. plot::

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import pydicom

    from pylinac import image
    from pylinac.core.io import retrieve_demo_file, TemporaryZipDirectory

    demo_zip = retrieve_demo_file('drgs.zip')
    with TemporaryZipDirectory(demo_zip) as tmpzip:
        image_files = image.retrieve_image_files(tmpzip)

        # read the values "raw"
        dmlc_raw = pydicom.read_file(image_files[0])
        open_raw = pydicom.read_file(image_files[1])
        raw = dmlc_raw.pixel_array / open_raw.pixel_array

        # Tag-correct the values
        img_dmlc = image.load(image_files[0])
        img_open = image.load(image_files[1])
        corrected = img_dmlc.array / img_open.array

    plt.plot(raw[200, :], label="Raw DICOM pixels")
    plt.plot(corrected[200, :], label="Using Rescale + Intercept Tags")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

  We can also scale the tag-corrected value for the purpose of comparing relative responses:

  .. plot::
    :include-source: false

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import pydicom

    from pylinac import image
    from pylinac.core.io import retrieve_demo_file, TemporaryZipDirectory

    demo_zip = retrieve_demo_file('drgs.zip')
    with TemporaryZipDirectory(demo_zip) as tmpzip:
        image_files = image.retrieve_image_files(tmpzip)

        # read the values "raw"
        dmlc_raw = pydicom.read_file(image_files[0])
        open_raw = pydicom.read_file(image_files[1])
        raw = dmlc_raw.pixel_array / open_raw.pixel_array

        # Tag-correct the values
        img_dmlc = image.load(image_files[0])
        img_open = image.load(image_files[1])
        corrected = img_dmlc.array / img_open.array

    plt.plot(raw[200, :], label="Raw DICOM pixels")
    plt.plot(23*corrected[200, :], label="Using Rescale + Intercept Tags * 23")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

  The point of the second plot is to show what the ratio of each ROI looks like
  between the normalizations. Inspecting the left-most ROI, we see that the
  raw pixel normalization is lower than the average ROI response, whereas with
  the tag-corrected implementation, it's actually higher. When evaluating
  the ROI results of pylinac vs other programs this explains why the left-most ROI
  (which is used simply as an example) has a positive deviation whereas other
  programs may have a negative deviation.

  This behavior can change depending on the tags available in the DICOM file. Newer DICOMs
  also have a "sign" tag to correct for inversion of pixel data. Why this difference can be
  problematic is that the ratio of the open to DMLC image depends on the initial pixel value.

  Currently, this is a philosophical difference between programs that don't use DICOM
  tags and those that do, like pylinac. If the goal is to switch from another program
  to pylinac, the standard approach of measuring with both algorithms to establish
  a baseline of differences is recommended, just as you might when switching from a
  water tank measurement to an array-based measurement scheme.


.. _vmat-doselab:

Comparison to Doselab
"""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 3.13

All that being said, if the goal is to match another program (specifically, Doselab, although this might apply to
others) use the following:

.. code-block:: python

  from pylinac import DRMLC

  drmlc = DRMLC(..., raw_pixels=True, ground=False, check_inversion=False)
  ...

This will skip the checking of DICOM tags for correcting the pixel values as well
as other manipulations normally applied.

Here's a table comparing the results of the DRMLC demo dataset with different variations:

+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|                                                    | Max R_dev | ROI 1 R_dev | ROI 2 R_dev | ROI 3 R_dev | ROI 4 R_dev |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Doselab (normalized)                               |           |       0.995 |       1.005 |       1.006 |       0.994 |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Doselab (as % from unity)                          | 0.60%     |      -0.50% |       0.50% |       0.60% |      -0.60% |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Pylinac (raw=True, ground=False, inversion=False)  | 0.56%     |      -0.54% |       0.53% |       0.56% |      -0.55% |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Pylinac (default)                                  | 0.89%     |      -0.68% |       0.89% |      -0.10% |      -0.11% |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Pylinac (raw=False, ground=False, inversion=False) | 0.90%     |      -0.68% |       0.90% |      -0.08% |      -0.12% |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

The Doselab and pylinac results are very similar when the raw pixels are used.
The default settings and the analysis without any extra manipulations are also extremely similar.

.. note::

  For historical continuity, the manipulations are set to ``True``. If you are just starting to
  use Pylinac, it is recommended to use the settings of the last row. However,
  it is unlikely to make a significant difference.
