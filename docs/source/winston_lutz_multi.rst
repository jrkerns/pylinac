=========================
Winston-Lutz Multi-Target
=========================

Overview
--------

.. versionadded:: 3.9

The Multi-Target Winston-Lutz (MTWL) is an advanced test category meant to measure multiple locations away from isocenter,
typically to represent multi-lesion SRS cases. The MTWL module can analyze images with any number of BBs in any
arrangement. It is generalizable such that new phantom analyses can be created quickly.

Technically, there are two flavors of multi-target WL: multi-field and single field. An
example of a multi-field WL is the SNC MultiMet. Each field is centered around each BB.
The BB position is compared to that of the field. This is closest to what the patient
experiences since it incorporates both the gantry/coll/couch deviations as well as
the MLCs.

An example of a single-field multi-target WL is Machine Performance Check. The
BBs are compared to the known positions. This removes the error of the MLCs
to isolate just the gantry/coll/couch.

Currently, only the multi-field flavor is supported, but work on the single-field flavor
will occur to support things like secondary checks of MPC.

This is why the class is called ``WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField`` as
there will be an anticipated ``WinstonLutzMultiTargetSingleField``.

Differences from single-target WL
---------------------------------

.. warning::

    The MTWL algorithm is new and provisional. There are a number of limitations with the algorithm. Hopefully,
    these are removed in future updates. The algorithm is still considered valuable even with these limitations
    which is why it is released.

.. important::

    In a nutshell, the MTWL analyzes BB positions only, whereas vanilla WL provides more machine-related data as well as
    BB position data.

Unlike the single-target WL algorithm (aka "vanilla" WL), there are more limitations to acquisition and
outputs. This should improve over time, but for now you can think of the MTWL as a subset of the
vanilla WL algorithm:

* Utility methods such as loading images are the same.
* Outputs related to the BBs are different.
* BB size is not a parameter but is part of the BB arrangement.
* Single images cannot be analyzed.
* Axis deviations (Gantry wobble, etc) are not yet available.
* Interpreting filenames is not yet allowed.

See the following sections for more info.

* :ref:`mtwl_image_acquisition`
* :ref:`mtwl_phantoms`

Running the Demo
----------------

To run the multi-target Winston-Lutz demo, create a script or start an interpreter session and input:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField

    WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField.run_demo()

Results will be printed to the console and a figure showing the zoomed-in images will be generated::

.. _mtwl_image_acquisition:

Image Acquisition
-----------------

The Winston-Lutz module will only load EPID images. The images can be from any EPID however and any SID. To ensure
the most accurate results the following should be noted:


- The BBs should not occlude each other.
- The BBs should be >10mm apart in any given image by default.
- Not all BBs must be seen in all images; i.e. some BBs can be hidden.
- The radiation fields should have >5mm separation in any given image.

Coordinate Space
----------------

The MTWL algorithm uses the same coordinate system as the vanilla WL. :ref:`coordinate_space`.

Passing a coordinate system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No coordinate system is passed or used (yet).

.. note::

    This is a target for the MTWL algorithm, so expect this to change in the future.

.. _mtwl_phantoms:

Supported Phantoms
------------------

Currently, only the `MultiMet-WL <https://www.sunnuclear.com/products/multimet-wl-cube>`__ cube from SNC is supported.
However, the algorithm is generalized and
can be easily adapted to analyze other phantoms. See :ref:`custom-bb-arrangements`.

Typical Use
-----------

Analyzing a multi-target Winston-Lutz test is simple. First, let's import the class:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField
    from pylinac.winston_lutz import BBArrangement

From here, you can load a directory:

.. code-block:: python

    my_directory = "path/to/wl_images"
    wl = WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField(my_directory)

You can also load a ZIP archive with the images in it:

.. code-block:: python

    wl = WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField.from_zip("path/to/wl.zip")

Now, analyze it. Unlike the vanilla WL algorithm, we have to pass the BB arrangement to know where the BBs should be in space.
:ref:`Preset phantoms <mtwl_phantoms>` exist, or a custom arrangement can be passed.

.. code-block:: python

    wl.analyze(bb_arrangement=BBArrangement.SNC_MULTIMET)

And that's it! You can now view images, print the results, or publish a PDF report:

.. code-block:: python

    # plot all the images
    wl.plot_images()
    # save figures of the image plots for each bb
    wl.save_images(prefix="snc")
    # print to PDF
    wl.publish_pdf("mymtwl.pdf")

Visualizing BBs in space
------------------------

The BBs can be visualized by using the :meth:`~pylinac.winston_lutz.WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField.plot_location` method
and will show all the measured BB locations and their nominal locations.

.. plot::
  :include-source: false

          (30*sin(5), 0, 30*cos(5)),

      ),
  )

  wl = WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField(mtmf)
  wl.analyze(bb_arrangement=BBA)
  wl.plot_location()


Changing BB detection size
--------------------------

To change the size of BB pylinac is expecting you must change it in the BB arrangement. This
allows phantoms with multiple BB sizes to still be analyzed. See :ref:`custom-bb-arrangements`

.. _custom-bb-arrangements:

Custom BB Arrangements
----------------------


.. note::

    .. versionchanged:: 3.22

    The BB arrangement was changed to a be a class instance instead of a simple dictionary. See :class:`~pylinac.winston_lutz.BBConfig`.

The MTWL algorithm uses a priori BB arrangements. I.e. you need to know where the BBs **should** exist in
space relative to isocenter. The MTWL algorithm is flexible to accommodate any reasonable arrangement of BBs.

To create a custom arrangement, say for an in-house phantom or commercial phantom not yet supported, define the
BB offsets and size like so. Use negative values to move the other direction:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac.winston_lutz import BBConfig

    my_special_phantom_bbs = [
        BBConfig(
            name="Iso",
            offset_left_mm=0,
            offset_up_mm=0,
            offset_in_mm=0,
            bb_size_mm=5,
            rad_size_mm=20,
        ),  # 5mm BB at iso
        BBConfig(
            name="Left",
            offset_left_mm=30,
            offset_up_mm=0,
            offset_in_mm=0,
            bb_size_mm=4,
            rad_size_mm=20,
        ),  # 4mm BB 30mm to left of iso
        BBConfig(
            name="Down and In",
            offset_left_mm=0,
            offset_up_mm=-20,
            offset_in_mm=10,
            bb_size_mm=5,
            rad_size_mm=20,
        ),  # BB DOWN 20mm and in 10mm
        # keep going as needed
    ]

Pass it to the algorithm like so:

.. code-block:: python

    wl = WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField(...)
    wl.analyze(bb_arrangement=my_special_phantom_bbs)
    ...

Analysis Parameters
-------------------

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: usage

   .. tab-item:: pylinac
      :sync: pylinac

      See :meth:`~pylinac.winston_lutz.WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField.analyze` for details.

   .. tab-item:: RadMachine
      :sync: radmachine

      There are no specific parameters for the MTWL algorithm in RadMachine. RadMachine's analysis
      is specifically for the SNC MultiMet phantom, which has known BB positions and field sizes and placements.

Algorithm
---------

The MTWL algorithm is based on the vanilla WL algorithm. For each
BB and image combination, the image is searched at the nominal location
for the BB and radiation field. If it's not found it will be skipped for that combo.
The BB must be detected in at least one image or an error will be raised.

The algorithm works like such:

**Allowances**

* The images can be acquired with any EPID (aS500, aS1000, aS1200) at any SID.
* The image can have any number of BBs.
* The BBs can be at any 3D location.

**Restrictions**

.. warning:: Analysis can fail or give unreliable results if any Restriction is violated.

* BBs must not occlude or be <5 mm from each other in any 2D image.
* The radiation fields should have >5mm separation in any given image.

**Analysis**

This algorithm is performed for each BB and image combination:

* **Find the field center** -- The spread in pixel values (max - min) is divided by 2, and any pixels above
  the threshold is associated with the open field. The pixels are converted to black & white and
  the center of mass of the pixels is assumed to be the field center.

* **Find the BB** -- The image is converted to binary based on pixel values *both* above the 50% threshold as above,
  and below the upper threshold. The upper threshold is an iterative value, starting at the image maximum value,
  that is lowered slightly when the BB is not found. If the binary image has a reasonably circular ROI,
  is approximately the right size, and is within 5mm of the expected BB position, the BB is
  considered found and the pixel-weighted center of mass of the BB is considered the BB location.

* **Evaluate against the field position** -- Once the measured BB and field positions are known, both the scalar distance and vector
  from the field position to the measured BB position is determined.

Interpreting Results
--------------------

The results in RadMachine and those from calling ``results_data`` are as follows:

* ``num_total_images``: The total number of images analyzed.
* ``max_2d_field_to_bb_mm``: The maximum 2D distance from any BB to its field center.
* ``median_2d_field_to_bb_mm``: The median 2D distance from any BB to its field center.
* ``mean_2d_field_to_bb_mm``: The mean 2D distance from any BB to its field center.
* ``bb_arrangement``: A list of the nominal locations of the BBs. Each BB arrangement
  has the following items:

  * ``name``: The name of the BB.
  * ``offset_left_mm``: The offset in the left-right direction from isocenter. See: :ref:`coordinate_space`.
  * ``offset_up_mm``: The offset in the up-down direction from isocenter.
  * ``offset_in_mm``: The offset in the in-out direction from isocenter.
  * ``bb_size_mm``: The size of the BB in mm.
  * ``rad_size_mm``: The size of the radiation field in mm.

* ``bb_maxes``: A dictionary of the maximum 2D distances of each BB to its field center. The
  key is the BB name as defined in the arrangement.
* ``bb_shift_vector``: The vector (in 3D cartesian space) to move the phantom to align with the isocenter in mm.
* ``bb_shift_yaw``: The yaw rotation in degrees needed to align the phantom with the radiation isocenter.
* ``bb_shift_pitch``: The pitch rotation needed in degrees to align the phantom with the radiation isocenter.
* ``bb_shift_roll``: The roll rotation needed in degrees to align the phantom with the radiation isocenter.


Benchmarking the Algorithm
--------------------------

With the image generator module we can create test images to test the WL algorithm on known results. This is useful to isolate what is or isn't working
if the algorithm doesn't work on a given image and when commissioning pylinac. It is common, especially with the WL module,
to question the accuracy of the algorithm. Since no linac is perfect and the results are sub-millimeter, discerning what
is true error vs algorithmic error can be difficult. The image generator module is a perfect solution since it can remove or reproduce the former error.

.. note::

    With the introduction of the MTWL algorithm, so too a multi-target synthetic image generator has been created: :func:`~pylinac.core.image_generator.utils.generate_winstonlutz_multi_bb_multi_field`.

.. warning::

    The image generator is limited in accuracy to ~1/2 pixel because creating the image requires a row or column to
    be set. E.g. a 5mm field with a 0.336mm pixel size means we need to create a field of 14.88 pixels wide. We can only
    set the field to be 14 or 15 pixels, so the nearest field size of 15 pixels or 5.04mm is set.

2-BB Perfect Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a perfect set of fields with 1 BB at iso and another 20mm left, 20mm down, and 60mm inward (this is the same
as the demo, but is good for explanation).

.. plot::

    import pylinac
    from pylinac.winston_lutz import BBConfig
    from pylinac.core.image_generator import simulators, layers, generate_winstonlutz_multi_bb_multi_field

    wl_dir = 'wl_dir'
    generate_winstonlutz_multi_bb_multi_field(
            simulator=simulators.AS1200Image(sid=1000),
            field_layer=layers.PerfectFieldLayer,
            final_layers=[layers.GaussianFilterLayer(sigma_mm=1),],
            dir_out=wl_dir,
            field_offsets=((0, 0, 0), (20, -20, 60)),
            field_size_mm=(20, 20),
            bb_offsets=[[0, 0, 0], [20, -20, 60]],
    )
    arrange = (
        BBConfig(name='Iso', offset_left_mm=0, offset_up_mm=0, offset_in_mm=0, bb_size_mm=5, rad_size_mm=20),
        BBConfig(name='Left,Down,In', offset_left_mm=20, offset_up_mm=-20, offset_in_mm=60, bb_size_mm=5, rad_size_mm=20),
    )

    wl = pylinac.WinstonLutzMultiTargetMultiField(wl_dir)
    wl.analyze(bb_arrangement=arrange)
    print(wl.results())
    wl.plot_images()

which has an output of::

As shown, we have perfect results.

  2D distances
  ============
  Max 2D distance of any BB->Field: 1.01 mm
  Mean 2D distance of any BB->Field: 0.50 mm
  Median 2D distance of any BB->Field: 0.50 mm

Both BBs report a shift of 1mm. Note this is only in 0 and 180. A left shift would not be
captured at 90/270.


Random error
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's now add random error:

.. note::

    The error is random so performing this again will change the results slightly.
