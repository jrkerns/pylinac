    Parameters
    ----------

    reference
        The reference profile.
    evaluation
        The evaluation profile.
    reference_coordinates
        The x-values of the reference profile. If None, will be assumed to be evenly spaced from 0 to len(reference).
    evaluation_coordinates
        The x-values of the evaluation profile. If None, will be assumed to be evenly spaced from 0 to len(evaluation).
    dose_to_agreement
        The dose to agreement in %. E.g. 1 is 1% of global reference max dose.
    distance_to_agreement
        The distance to agreement in x-values. If no x-values are passed, this is in elements.
        If x-values are passed, this is in the units of the x-values. E.g. if the x-values are in mm and the distance to agreement is 1, this is 1 mm.
        Must be >0.
    gamma_cap_value
        The value to cap the gamma at. E.g. a gamma of 5.3 will get capped to 2. Useful for displaying data with a consistent range.
    global_dose
        Whether to evaluate the dose to agreement threshold based on the global max or the dose point under evaluation.
    dose_threshold
        The dose threshold as a number between 0 and 100 of the % of max dose under which a gamma is not calculated.
        This is not affected by the global/local dose normalization and the threshold value is evaluated against the global max dose, period.
    resolution_factor
        The factor by which to resample the reference profile to be compared to the evaluation profile. Depends on the distance to agreement.
        If the distance to agreement is 1 mm and the resolution factor is 3, the reference profile will be resampled to 0.333 mm resolution.
        The rule of thumb is to use at least 3x the distance to agreement. Higher factors will increase computation time.
    fill_value
        The value to give pixels that were not calculated because they were under the dose threshold. Default
        is NaN, but another option would be 0. If NaN, allows the user to calculate mean/median gamma over just the
        evaluated portion and not be skewed by 0's that should not be considered.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The gamma values. The dimensions will be the same as the evaluation profile.
    np.ndarray
        The resampled reference profile. Useful for plotting.
