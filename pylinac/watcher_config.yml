# Pylinac Watcher Service Configuration File
# See documentation here: http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/latest/watcher.html#configuration
# Copy and edit this file to customize analysis
# For each section's `analysis` group, the values correspond to the main class' `analyze()` keyword parameters.
# The `failure` section is the criteria for sending "failure" emails
# keywords are character sequences that must be in the file name to be considered of that analysis type


general:
  directory: path/to/analysis/directory  # path to the folder where analysis is performed;
                                         # can also be specified as keyword arg in the `start_watching` and `process` functions
  file-suffix: _analysis  # the suffix added to the .png and .txt file created after analysis
  avoid-keywords:  # keywords in a file name that cause a skip of analysis
    - .png
    - .txt
  query-frequency: 60  # the frequency at which pylinac queries new files; units are in seconds; N/A if using the `process` function
  use-classifier: false  # set to true to use an SVM classifier which can automatically
                         # identify starshot, picket fence, pipspro, and leeds images.
                         # Experimental; may not always identify images correctly and cause errors.

email:
  enable-all: false  # set to true to send an email after every analysis
  enable-failure: false  # set to true to only send an email after an analysis fails
  sender: sender@gmail.com  # sender MUST be a Gmail account
