# Copy and edit this file to customize analysis
# For each section's `analysis` group, the values correspond to the main class' `analyze()` keyword parameters.
# The `failure` section is the criteria for sending "failure" emails
# keywords are character sequences that must be in the file name to be considered of that analysis type

  file-suffix: _analysis  # the suffix added to the .png and .txt file created after analysis
  avoid-keywords:  # keywords that cause a skip of analysis

  enable-all: false  # set to true to send an email after every analysis
  enable-failure: false  # set to true to only send an email after an analysis fails
