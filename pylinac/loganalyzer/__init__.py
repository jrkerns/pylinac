"""The pylinac Log Analyzer module is designed to read in and qualitatively and quantitatively analyze linac log files from Varian
machines. Both Clinac-era (dynalogs) and TrueBeam-era (trajectory) logs are readable. The logs are read in according to the formats
described in the DynaLog File Viewer & Reference Guide and the TrueBeam 1.5/2.0 Trajectory Log File Specification, both available at
my.varian.com.
